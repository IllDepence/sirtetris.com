# Context
*The world is full of interesting things to be discovered, learned, practiced. As one searches for new input, advice from others already into a specific matter can be of great help. Therefore I'd like to share what keeps me moving, learning, living and offer hints and resources for the potentially interested.*

# Japanese language<span id="japanese"></span>
*日本語はとても凄いですよ！　ヽ(\*・ω・)ﾉ*

![](static/img/interests/jp.jpg)

Prepare to face three different, partly redundant, simultaneously used scripts; characters made up of more than 20 strokes — whose order you have to get right btw. — with various ways to read and interpret them depending on their current context; and over 30 common, individual ways to count things, each assiciated with a group of things it's used for.

On the other hand pronunciation is fairly easy and super consistent, grammar is totally manageable and there are awesome aspects like the word for “influence”, 「影響」, being written with the characters for “shadow” and “resonance”; or “strategy”, 「戦略」, with “battle” and “shortcut”.

# かるた<span id="karuta"></span>
*難波津に…*

![](static/img/interests/karuta.jpg)

「かるた」 ([karuta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karuta)) is a Japanese loanword originally from Portuguese (“carta”) and a term used to describe several types of Japanese card games. A particularly interesting group of which is called 歌がるた and often based on the poem collection 小倉百人一首 ([Ogura Hyakunin Isshu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogura_Hyakunin_Isshu)) by 藤原 定家 ([Fujiwara no Teika](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujiwara_no_Teika)).  
競技かるた ([kyōgi karuta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_karuta)) is the competitive version of 歌がるた.

If you want to get an overview of かるた-type games and more detailed information feel free to have a look at [this info page](http://moc.sirtetris.com/karuta/) I created. A brief peak into kyōgi karuta right here:

An English version of the rules of kyōgi karuta can be found [here](http://karuta.game.coocan.jp/simplerule-e.html). Further useful resources:

* [Japan Karuta Association](http://www.karuta.or.jp/) (up-to-date information about tournaments)
* [World of Kyogi Karuta](http://karuta.game.coocan.jp/index.html)
* [Hyakunin Isshu overview with english translations](http://etext.virginia.edu/japanese/hyakunin/index.html)

To get an idea of how kyōgi karuta is played, watch one of the following videos:
<!-- ytdd:Explanatory karuta match with English commentary:nKAmZxVhQww -->
<!-- ytdd:Recording of a karuta match with visual aids and slow motion replays:BiID7_0aqsc -->

Even more goodies:

* [the flickr account](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/nzkka/) of the New Zealand Karuta Association
* [a nice essay](http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~xs3d-bull/essays/karuta/karuta.html) about kyōgi karuta

‌  
A fun way to learn more about the world of karuta would be reading the manga [Chihayafuru](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihayafuru) or watching the anime adaptaion.

# Penspinning<span id="penspinning"></span>
*Contact juggling with pens!*

![](static/img/interests/ps.jpg)

Getting into penspinning is quite easy. You grab a more or less balanced pen, look at a video tutorial online and practice &mdash; that's it.  
It is, of course, more fun when you also get involved with the community. The largest international board on the topic of penspinning is the [UPSB](http://upsb.info/), I guess. Most contries also have their own board/community. Try to look out for gatherings. It's most fun when you meet other spinners in person and talk to them. :)

After I started penspinning in 2007 I actively did it — meaning I really took my time to practice, looked out for new tricks to learn, etc. — for maybe a year and a half. Since then I only do it casually, barely try or practice new stuff ... but it's still a lot of fun to do it and I don't plan to stop. :)

# Self-management<span id="management"></span>
*Information, time, habits, health, ...*

![](static/img/interests/infotime.png)

I only recently(-ish) started to really think about ways to organize my life and myself more efficiently. Ever since the podcast [Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm/) popped into existence [CGP Grey](http://www.cgpgrey.com/) seems to me like a figure to aspire to in that regard but ... I'm not an Apple user, so no OmniFocus for me. Jests aside, here's some relevant stuff:

#### A personal wiki
In order to organize information I use [gitit](http://gitit.net/). Reasons: Markdown, subfolders, MathJax, git based.

#### Memorize stuff (SRS)
[Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) — ever since I set out to learn 2000+ Japanese characters. Have something that you'd like to memorize efficiently and forever? SRS!

#### Misc
* GitHub for code and configs
* Kindle instead of analog books for mobility
* <s>[HabitRPG](https://habitrpg.com/)</s> tried it, didn't work out for me

# Mechanical keyboards<span id="keyboards"></span>
*High quality input devices. :3*

![](static/img/interests/mechkb.png)

Most keyboards today are so called [rubber dome](http://deskthority.net/wiki/Rubber_dome) or [scissor switch](http://deskthority.net/wiki/Scissor_switch) keyboards. They're cheap to produce and do their job. There are, however, other types of keyboards which in general are referred to as *mechanical keyboards*.

The exact mechanisms of how mechanical keyboard switches work differ from each other. In most cases the switches of one vendor have colored stems which give them their name and indicate their tactile and acoustic behaviour. More information can be found in the [deskthority wiki](http://deskthority.net/wiki/Category:Keyboard_switches).  
The reason for most people to use a mechanical keyboard is the higher quality and durability, the fact that you can choose a swich type that fits your "taste" the best and generally the more comfortable feeling when typing. If you're interested in the topic be sure to check out  [deskthority.net](http://deskthority.net/), [/r/MechanicalKeyboards](http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/) and [geekhack.org](http://geekhack.org/).

I myself use a KBC Poker with Cherry MX Blue switches as primary keyboard (the one on top on the picture above) and I also own a Leopold FC500RT/AB with MX Browns (middle) as well as a SteelSeries 7G with MX Blacks (bottom).

# (Urban) Exploration<span id="exploration"></span>
*Because it's there.*

To get an idea of what it is about, watch [Crack The Surface - Episode I](http://vimeo.com/26200018) and [Episode II](http://vimeo.com/35626914).  
In short, it is the exploration of man-made stuff. Objects of interest vary as much as reasons to do it I guess. For me, personally, it's about adventure, appreciation and to some extend photography. Sadly though, I only *very* rarely got around to do it so far.<br><br>

# Lock picking<span id="lockpicking"></span>
*Locks are meant to keep honest people honest.*

If you are interested in lock picking you might want to take a look at the [MIT Guide to Lock Picking](http://lockpickguide.com/support-files/mitguidetolockpick.pdf). Another great starting point is Schuyler Towne's video series [Locks: Basic operation and manipulation](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL66CD42F86F3A1F85).  
Further places to look for interesting content include [TOOOL](http://toool.us/) (The Open Organisation Of Lockpickers), [/r/lockpicking](http://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/) and the [DEF CON Media Archives Portal](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives.html), where you can find a lot of recorded talks on the subject of lock picking and physical security in general.

# Speedrunning<span id="speedrunning"></span>
*Playing through games quickly, skillfully, and legitimately.*

![](static/img/interests/agdq.jpg)

Concerning what I know about speedruns the place to go is the [Speed Demos Archive](http://speeddemosarchive.com/). If you want to get a general idea of what a speedrun is and what a speedrunner does, take a look at:  
<!-- ytdd:Portal Done Pro:W1U5RUVENNE -->

*and* the [Portal Done Pro - Commentary Video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL359B764A0A3B8188). Note that this run does not comply with the rules of SDA and is not listed there. Nonetheless does it give a nice impression of what speedrunning means. A very entertaining way to learn a bit more about speedruns can be following one of SDA's [marathons](http://marathon.speeddemosarchive.com/), where a group of speedrunners plays through a ton of games in a few days. Most of them comment on what they are doing while playing, so you get an insight on what the key techniques are for running a particular game.

As opposed to speedruns gathered at SDA there are also runs called TAS, tool-assisted speedruns. I don't know a lot about them, but I guess [TASVideos](http://tasvideos.org/) is a good resource to start with.

I myself never did serious speedrunning. Further down some casual (and old) stuff.
