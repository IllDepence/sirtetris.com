What I found was JE-EJ dictionaries, \u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1\u7b2c\u4e03\u7248 for \u20ac89.99 and people in forums suggesting apps that wouldn't work offline. On my most recent desperate search I even came across a *geoblocked dictionary* app\u2014to top it all off by a company deriving their name from the words \"big\" and \"globe\". m(\r\n\r\nAt this point I thought about just solving the problem myself. Looking at some dictionary websites, I found one where the entries were nicely enumerated from 1 to 297,199, so I wrote a small crawling script. In the meantime I used scholarly search engines to see if there happened to be some open data sets that could be used. I would've just thrown terms and definitions in an SQLite DB and installed some SQLite viewer on my phone.\r\n\r\nIn the end I found a better solution. One that's accessible and doesn't require technical skill\u2014which is why I'm writing this. Watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-AfT8XW63w) (by [this guy](https://massimmersionapproach.com/about/)) I learned about [EPWING](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPWING), a JIS standardized [format](https://web.archive.org/web/20060106055719/http://www.epwing.or.jp/about/about.html) for digital dictionaries. Now, looking at aforementioned video you might get your hands on some such dictionaries. All you then need is an app to interface with them: I quickly found [DroidWing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aokabi.android.droidwingfree), which I happily link here because the author also distributes a [paid version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aokabi.android.droidwing) where the only difference is the icon color. <3\r\n\r\nSo yeah, not bound to any service provider, platform independent, offline ... \u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 case solved for good. :3\r\n\r\n(This is just to feed the Google, in case someone else also looks for a solution to this: \u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9 \u30a2\u30d7\u30ea \u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u56fd\u8a9e \u8f9e\u5178 \u8f9e\u66f8 \u30aa\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3 \u7121\u6599.)", "id": "bbcb7e53", "tags": ["japanese"], "date": "2019-03-24", "headline": "Monolingual Japanese offline dictionaries for Android", "image": "kokugojiten.jpg"}, {"text": "[Five years ago](?a=662849f9) I realized Amazon deems Japanese books incompatible with the [Kindle 4](https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Amazon_Kindle_4) and suggested using [<!-- mixlang:\u9752\u7a7a\u6587\u5eab:the Japanese equivalent of Project Gutenberg -->](https://www.aozora.gr.jp/) as an alternative source for e-books. While I wholeheartedly suggest you always search for [DRM free](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/) sources for your e-books first, there are cases where Amazon simply seems to be the only available source.\r\n\r\nIn the following I'm going to show a viable way to handle Japanese e-books from Amazon, for people still holding on to a Kindle\u00a04.\r\n\r\n**what does work**\r\n\r\n* vertical writing with PDFs\r\n* Japanese file names\r\n\r\n**what doesn't seem to work**\r\n\r\n* vertical writing with AZW3 files\r\n* highlighting text in vertical writing\r\n* links (e.g. from the TOC) in vertical writing\r\n* proper dictionary function\r\n\r\nBefore jumping right into the technical stuff, be reminded that *if* you're okay with reading on your PC or phone, the easy solution is to just get the Kindle app and have your e-book delivered to that. If it is to be the Kindle, here's how that works:\r\n\r\nIf you're on Linux, get a [Windows 10 VM](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines), install the Kindle app and load the books you want to transfer to your kindle from your library. Now, word has it there are ways to free books you bought from Amazon from their DRM. For the purpose of this explanation we're just going to assume you have a DRM free AZW3 file. If you prefer to read your book in horizontal writing, you're basically done at this point. Copy the file to your Kindle and curse Amazon for not allowing you to send it to the device directly. For verical writing there are a few more steps to go through.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't already done so, download [Calibre](https://www.calibre-ebook.com/) and add a book (probably a AZW3-file) to your collection. To generate a PDF with vertical writing we're going to use [<!-- mixlang:\u9752\u7a7a\u30ad\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb:a very nice website -->](http://a2k.aill.org/text.html) which takes plain text as input. Unfortunately, exporting a book as TXT in Calibre will mess with furigana (append them as normal text). To get proper furigana, export the book as HTMLZ and from the resulting archive extract the file `index.html`. To convert the HTML file into plain text  while preserving furigana in a format <!-- mixlang:\u9752\u7a7a\u30ad\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb:aforementioned website --> understands, use the script `html2txt_ruby.py` from [this repository](https://github.com/IllDepence/calibre_html2aozora_txt). Running `python3 html2txt_ruby.py index.html` will give you a file `out.txt`. Use this as your input for \u9752\u7a7a\u30ad\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb (you will most likely want to edit the first few lines of the text to get a proper cover page).\r\n\r\nNow, PDF file names. Five years ago I noticed [problems with book names](static/img/blog/jp_kindle_3.jpg) when just copying over PDF files with Japanese names. The Kindle takes the author's name from a PDF's metadata, but doesn't do this for the title. The title is taken from the file name and non Latin characters in file names can be a mess to deal with on FAT file systems. To get Japanese file names for PDFs properly displayed, mount your kindle with the parameter `-o uni_xlate=1`\\* and use the script `uni_xlate_filename.py` from [this repository](https://github.com/IllDepence/calibre_html2aozora_txt) generate an encoded file name. Example: running `python3 uni_xlate_filename.py \u4f7f\u7528\u4f8b` will give you `:4f7f:7528:4f8b`. Meaning if you name a PDF file on your Kindle `:4f7f:7528:4f8b.pdf` while mounted with the parameter mentioned above, it will show up as `\u4f7f\u7528\u4f8b` on the device.\r\n\r\nAnd with that you can enjoy Japanese books from Amazon in vertical writing on a Kindle 4. No need to abandon a device that's still working perfectly fine. :)  \r\n\r\n<small>\\*See man page of [mount](https://linux.die.net/man/8/mount) (search for \"unhandled Unicode\") for details.</small>", "id": "1b33363e", "tags": ["japanese", "hardware"], "date": "2018-09-20", "headline": "Japanese books on a Kindle 4", "image": "jp_kindle_2018.jpg"}, {"text": "Nine months in Japan \u2014 last review:\r\n\r\nGiven I already felt like *on my way back* towards the end of last month, my last weeks felt pretty relaxed.

Given the corresponding Japanese article, which I used as a base, was lacking references, I went on a hunt through Japanese papers on the topic. Several works on specific related matters cited a paper with the title *<!-- mixlang:\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u642d\u8f09\u30b1\u30fc\u30bf\u30a4\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5165\u529b\u65b9\u5f0f\u306e\u8a55\u4fa1:An evaluation of input system on the touch panel phone -->* for their general explanation of what flick input is.

Even one of the library personnel checked for any trace, but to no avail. No printed matter available and no online access in any of the subscriptions of the NII. What do you do at that point?

Upon closer inspection it turned out Facebook had translated their German post into the language my account is set to display. This made me very aware \u2014 for a moment \u2014 that the fact in which language something is written carries information. Why did *they* suddenly post in Japanese? (Well ... they didn't.)  \r\nIf, let's say, a Chinese acquaintance of whom I know that they don't know any German sent me birthday whishes in German, then they went through the trouble of goolging for German birthday whishes, using Google Translate or asking someone. In a similar fashion I report of elevators saying <!-- mixlang:\u300c\u672c\u65e5\u306f\u3054\u82e6\u52b4\u69d8\u3067\u3057\u305f\u300d:&quot;Thank you for your hard work today&quot; --> at my lab \u2014 because they do so in Japanese. Other times using a word from another language is just more concise and feels more accurate. Instead of talking about *\"a type of bicycle with a front basked often used by mothers\"* or leaving out information and just writing *\"bicycle\"* I name the thing by its name and say <!-- mixlang:\u300c\u30de\u30de\u30c1\u30e3\u30ea\u300d:&quot;mama-chari&quot; -->. \r\n\r\nThe obvious problem with this is that my recent blog posts only really make sense to people that can read English and \u2014 at least some \u2014 Japanese. This made me think about working with `Accept-Language` headers. Just parse what a user's browser tells me about their language capabilities and display content accordingly.\r\n\r\nTo figure out how I'd go about the *display content accordingly* part I googled *\"mixed language web content\"* and similar things. This yielded a lot of SEO articles saying *DON'T!*, a few W3C resources on how to mark and style parts of text depending on language and even an interesting looking book titled *Language Mixing and Code-Switching in Writing*. No solution though for my balancing act between information/authenticity and audience/intelligibility.\r\n\r\nSo, I played around myself and [came up with](https://github.com/IllDepence/mixed-language-web-content-test) this: <!-- mixlang:\u4f8b:example --> \u2190 if your browser tells me you understand Japanese you will just see \u300c\u4f8b\u300d, otherwise the word will have a grey-ish background and when you hover over it, it will display \"example\".  \r\nBest thing about them? They're purely done in CSS. :3 (See [the code here](https://github.com/IllDepence/mixed-language-web-content-test/blob/master/single.html).) On the server side of things it gets a little bit unaesthetic \u2014 sadly. I maintain the contents of this website in Markdown and extra stuff is added in *after* parsing. For mixed language strings I use the following construct `<\u200c!-- mixlang:\u4f8b:example -->`. Not quite as concise as e.g. Markdown links but well ... HTML comments go through the parser untouched and then I built my small `<span>` matryoshkas. Writing a Markdown extention would be an alternative but I don't have the time for looking into that right now.\r\n\r\nBy the time this post goes live I will have gone through my backlog of posts and added in optional English translation for all non English strings. <!-- mixlang:\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u3067:(even) if you prepare them with the microwave they'll be  -->good!", "tags": ["japanese", "programming", "website", "i18n/l10n"], "id": "801a3c9b", "date": "2018-03-16", "headline": "Mixed language content", "image": "mixed_language_content.jpg"}, {"text": "Month four \u2014 one thrid left; review:\r\n\r\nAnki ok.

The exam can be passed with a very good grade solely based on the information given on the slides plus what is being said during the lecture, but students are advised to also look into referenced books and papers (I didn't). The exam consists of (iirc) 50 multiple choice questions, each of which has 5 answers of which between 0 and 5 are correct. Choosing a correct answer or not choosing a wrong answer results in 1 point. Not choosing a correct answer or choosing a wrong answer results in -1 point. The overall points for one question are reset to 0 in case they're negative. Example questions given for the exams go as deep as asking for names of authors or effect sizes of specific studies.\r\n\r\n**The solution**  \r\n\r\n* Attend all the lectures, annotate the slides (yellow boxes in the image above)\r\n* Start preparing for the exam about 3 weeks in advance, within these 3 weeks:\r\n* Spend a total of 14 hours to write a summary of the lecture's content (25 pages)\r\n* Spend a total of 9 hours to create Anki cards (477 cards)\r\n* Spend a total of 12 hours reviewing these Anki cards (2775 reviews)\r\n* Squeeze in 5 days of preparation for another exam with less material to learn\r\n* Pass with a <span title=\"2.7\">not so great result</span>, having spent a total of 35 hours on exam preparation (not counting lecture attendance)\r\n\r\n\u2192 [Anki stats](static/img/blog/anki-stats-aopsycho_2017-02-16.png)", "date": "2017-04-14", "headline": "Anki for exams", "tags": ["education", "time"], "id": "8c0f44ca", "image": "aopsycho.jpg"}, {"text": "I recently stumbled upon xkcd's comic on the idea of a [28-Hour Day](https://xkcd.com/320/).

Now, if you own a device with a type F plug (let's say, a laptop) and want to get an adapter for type A sockets, *don't even bother looking*. F\u2192B and C\u2192A adapters are readily available, and because A plugs also work with B sockets, C\u2192B is unnecessary. But since F plugs are earthed and A plugs are not ... no F\u2192A adapters. And for the same reason you also can not find F\u2192C adapters to build a funny F\u2192C\u2192A adapter parade.  \r\nThe only option you're left with (to my best knowledge) for plugging in a laptop from Germany to a power socket in Japan, is to find a C\u2192A adapter with unnecessarily large pin holes (type C plugs have 4 mm pins whereas type F plugs have 4.8 mm pins), remove anything put into place to *stop* people from forcing F plugs into the adapter and then do exactly that. [Here's my take](static/img/blog/myj15_add0.jpg), on the unavailability of F\u2192A and F\u2192C adapters.\r\n\r\n**University**  \r\n- *Classes* are interesting. I take 4 Japanese classes (essay writing<sup>[1]</sup>, reading skills<sup>[2][3][4]</sup>, mixed<sup>[5][6]</sup>, oral communication) as well as 3 grad school classes (linguistics<sup>[7]</sup>, sociolinguistics<sup>[8]</sup>, intercultural communication: the Japanese experience<sup>[9][10][11][12][13][14][15]</sup>).  \r\n- The *dorm* is nice. Rooms are spacious, everything you'd need in terms of appliances and so on is present, people are nice \u2014 I'm the only European; actually I'm the only one that is not from either China, Taiwan or South Korea. :D  \r\n- I'm also happy with the *canteen*. Food tastes good and thus far a meal cost me \uffe5 465 (3.45 \u20ac) on average.  \r\n- *Staff* and people in general are super helpful and friendly.  \r\n- *Clubs* (<!-- mixlang:\u90e8\u6d3b:bukatsu -->) are still kind of on my todo list. Visited two, but was too busy until now to look at more and/or join in on regular activities.   \r\nA difference to my previous experience with German universities, and actually a thing I'm not super happy with (though that's just a matter of taste), is the fact that the intended way of getting something done that may not be everyday business seems to be to go to a person in charge of that thing and ask them to take care of it. What I'm used to is informing myself and doing stuff on my own. Where I'm used to finding a guide for how to do something on a university's website I'm now finding a telephone number or description to which office I need to go. Same goes for information I would have expected to be readily available online (like e-mail addresses of professors). I'm curious whether or not I will, over time, get used to this default way of doing things. Or if I just misjudge the situation right now and all the university related exchange student setup procedures just were really out of the ordinary requiring an unusual amount of \u201coffice hopping\u201c. \r\n\r\n**Life**  \r\nIn the first weeks I've been [exploring the city](static/img/blog/myj15_add1.gif) on my [\u201cmamachari\u201c](static/img/blog/myj15_add2.jpg) quite a bit. Initially I was focussing on traditional stuff like [shrines](static/img/blog/myj15_add3.jpg), [temples](static/img/blog/myj15_add4.jpg) and [onsen](static/img/blog/myj15_add5.jpg). At the moment I'm more likely to look for either something recreational like public parks and sports facilities or utility oriented places like supermarkets.  \r\nWhat I've yet to find is a few cheap and healthy \u201cbase foods\u201c for the evening and especially morning. In Germany that used to be [muesli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muesli), bananas, whole-grain bread with cheese ... most of which is pretty much non-existent here.  \r\nI'm okay with rice+<!-- mixlang:\u3075\u308a\u304b\u3051:furikake (rice seasoning) --> and a small side dish, but cooking rice takes time. I've tried working with tofu, but haven't found an easy and quick way to make it tasty yet. What I'm pretty happy with are instant noodles. :D But I'd prefer something healthier.  \r\n\r\nAll in all, I'm happy with my current situation. :) As mentioned in my [previous post](?a=047d4541) I was curious how much different it would be ... never having lived more than 100 km away from where I grew up, suddenly living over 9,000 (not even intended, it's 9,358) km away ... turns out if you're used to living in a student dorm in a city in Germany and move to a student dorm in a city in Japan, it's really no big difference. (I guess if I'm honest with myself I wish it were a bit more different. ^^)\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'm in a position where I can experience a foreign country by as little as stepping outside the front door and I've got plenty of opportunity to use and improve my Japanese.

Which would've even been more severe had I not tweaked my learning routine a bit.\r\n\r\nTo save time I decided to stop writing out readings for recognition cards while continuing to write kanji + furigana for recall cards.

That means I learned more than nine words per day \u2014 which is pretty awesome compared to what I did before.  \r\nLooking at my [Anki stats](static/img/blog/anki_stats_131003.png): I learned every day and added new vocab on 25 of 30 days. On average I review 115 cards in 52 minutes. I require additional time to find new kanji, create mnemonics, find useful new vocab using those kanji, etc. So I guess it's reasonable to assume that I spend about 1.5 hours a day on Japanese vocab. Doesn't sound like an awful lot of time and yet the benefit is quite awesome. :)\r\n\r\nThe most important thing to note is, that I really made it a habit to go through all due Anki cards in the morning/early afternoon, add new kanji in the evening and go through these a bit later. If you're used to it, it's no burden.  \r\nFurther changes in my learning approach: I use [Tagaini Jisho](http://www.tagaini.net/) *a lot* more than before. And I more often use word frequency lists to find new useful vocab. Apart from that ... I sometimes find it useful to not sit in from of my computer with all its distractions when learning, so I use AnkiWeb on my Kindle which works fine.\r\n\r\nAs always, for the sake of documentation, these are the [kanji I know so far](static/dl/kanji_checkpoint_3).\r\n", "date": "2013-10-03", "headline": "\u6f22\u5b57 \u2014 300+", "tags": ["japanese", "kanji"], "id": "51c3029e", "image": "kanji_checkpoint_3.png"}, {"text": "Strange thing about Amazon: Japanese books (offered on amazon.com and amazon.de) are [not available for the standard Kindle](static/img/blog/jp_kindle_0.jpg) although it's perfectly capable of displaying Japanese content.

For some time I sticked with the JLPT kanji listed [here](http://tangorin.com/common_kanji), but it seems to take me longer and longer to find good candidates. I consider switching to going through easy reading material online and adding stuff I don't know yet. Another option would be using some frequency list.\r\n\r\nApart from that everything's going well. Creating mnemonics is still fun. :) Oh and when learning with Anki I now write out readings in katakana instead of hiragana from time to time \u2014 helps preventing that I forget those bastards. :D\r\n\r\nAgain, for the sake of documentation, these are the [kanji I know so far](static/dl/kanji_checkpoint_2).\r\n\r\n", "date": "2013-09-03", "headline": "\u6f22\u5b57 \u2014 200+", "tags": ["japanese", "kanji"], "id": "6a66c49c", "image": "kanji_checkpoint_2.png"}, {"text": "So, a mere 5% of J\u014dy\u014d kanji made their way into my head \u2014 and it's been fun so far, A LOT actually! :O\r\n\r\nI can't really say why exactly, but I guess first off because as I continue learning kanji I'm able to read more and more Japanese stuff and also because I can play around with mnemonics. :3  \r\nWhen I wrote about taking Japanese courses in my last post I was totally hyped. But in no way was I ready to get into kanji. I did a lot of preparation because the task seemed (and still seems) huge and I wanted to approach it in the best way possible.  \r\nI thought about learning the 214 radicals before looking at a single kanji, I looked at guides like TextFugu and WaniKani and started hoarding useful resources like [Jim Breen's Multi-Radical Selection](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwjdic.cgi?1R) ...\r\n\r\n... after about a month I knew how I would do it: TextFugu and the like present a great method for learning kanji effectively, but there are two problems. Frist they focus on kanji only and don't present them in context, as compounds (afaik). Second and most imporantly, they use given mnemonics. No way in hell does it make sense to use other people's associations to remember stuff. If \u8089 for me consists of a large gripper and two people which reminds me of Soylent Green and makes it super easy to remember then why should I try to remember it any other way?  \r\nThe thing with the official radicals is that sometimes they don't make sense to me, and for a lot of graphemes of given kanji there are no radicals. I cannot remember \u5202 as a mere variation of <!-- mixlang:\u5200:sword --> \u2014 they need very distinct mnemonic names/meanings or I'll mix them up.\r\n\r\nSo ... learning kanji for me works like this: I search for kanji made up of parts I already introduced to my mnemonic system that I'll use in sentences a lot. If I find no good candidates, I search for new graphemes/parts that will \"enable\" useful new kanji. As a new useful kanji is found I try to find at least two ways to use it in sentences \u2014 one where a kun reading is used and one where an on reading is used. Super easy example: I know <!-- mixlang:\u7530:rice field --> and <!-- mixlang:\u529b:strength -->, now I find <!-- mixlang:\u7537:man -->, super easy to remember and with <!-- mixlang:\u7537\u306e\u5b50:boy (&quot;otokonoko&quot;) --> and <!-- mixlang:\u7537\u5b50:boy (&quot;danshi&quot;) --> I already have two readings involved. \u7537 with it's readings, meanings and a mnemonic wind up in a json file from which I generate a web page displaying all my kanji with memonics and their parts/graphemes linked for ease of use. \u7537\u306e\u5b50 and \u7537\u5b50 are fresh input for my kanji deck in [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/). In the following days I then try to use \u7537\u306e\u5b50 and \u7537\u5b50 in homework for my Japanese courses and in journals on [Lang-8](http://lang-8.com/).

Which I, till then, only used for my beloved dash (\u2014).\r\n\r\nBut something was bothering me: while the origins of the \u00df are a bit complicated (the story includes the [long s](http://graphemica.com/%C5%BF) (\u017f), a character that isn't used anymore, and there were different versions of the ligature using either the z or the s) and German speaking countries that don't use the \u00df, like Swizerlad, use *ss* instead, it's present name *Eszett* (naming the letters *s* and *z*) and things like the HTML entity being &amp;szlig; (s z ligature) make the \u00df \u2014 for me at least \u2014 more a ligature of s and z than of s and s. Yet, the default compose sequence for \u00df is ss. I had to change that.\r\n\r\nWhile creating my own [.XCompose](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Accents_on_US_keyboards#Key_combinations) file I had the idea to create compose sequences for [hiragana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) (the reason why that's useful to me is a whole other story). But what would I use? &lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;a&gt; for \u3042, &lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;n&gt; &lt;o&gt; for \u306e, etc.? Would be quite annoying to be forced to hit the compose key (mapped to the [menu key](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_key) in my case) for each and every hiragana. There had to be a better solution.  \r\nI looked into [different input methods for Japanese](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Input_Japanese_using_uim), but aside from the fact, that they'd clearly be more sophisticated than what I'd come up with (due to me only having *really* basic knowledge of Japanese), they weren't really what I wanted to have.  \r\nI then thought about a separate .XCompose file for hiragana that simply woud map a to \u3042, n followed by o to \u306e etc. and which I could load using some key combination. Turns out you can't change your .XCompose file on the fly. You have to restart X. :/ (At least I found no way to do it.)\r\n\r\nAfter a while of thinking and testing I had the idea to use a modifier for my hiragana compose sequences. More specifically: a modifier that can be toggled on and of: **CAPSLOCK!**  \r\nWhat this means is, that for example a gets \"composed\" to \u3042, but only when the modifier is active. The cool thing about that is, that you even have an LED indicator for which \"input mode\" your in. LED off = romaji, LED on = hiragana. This of course can be used for anything. Instead of a hiragana mode you could have a writing upside down mode, a Greek mode, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you want to try it out, here's my current [.Xmodmap](static/dl/.Xmodmap) (swaps escape and caps lock and set's compose to the menu key) and here's my [.XCompose](static/dl/.XCompose) file.", "date": "2012-09-16", "headline": "Making use of caps lock.&emsp;...&emsp;No, seriously.", "tags": ["linux", "japanese"], "id": "079cf21f", "image": "coolcaps.jpg"}, {"text": "Maybe not that interesting, but I felt like this had to appear here. I got my RPi in July and recently started to build a Lego case for it. The one you see on the picture ([fullsize](static/img/blog/rpi0.jpg)) was initially just \"find as much red parts as possible and use the other colors to create a prototype\".  \r\nAfter a while I started to replace strange colors (brown, green, pink, etc.) and black as well as grey bricks in my prototype with similar parts in blue, white or yellow. What you see is how far I got ... a few flat parts and a bigger \"window\" for the LEDs are still to be found. The completely red version is far from complete. I'd need 9 1x1 flat bricks with a flat surface on the top \u2014 not sure if we have that much.\r\n\r\nAnyway \u2014 the Pi is up and running, serving mostly as an IRC client at the moment; guess it'll have the honor to take care of one or the orther cronjob in the near future and offer some web based \"services\" for me.\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous information: I got the idea to build a Lego case from [Biz's LEGO case](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1354). I used pants for my case because they leave a bit more space inside. Everything located above a slot is fixed to the lid, so the Pi can be taken out once the case is opened withough the need to take it apart. I noticed that my case might not leave enough space for an RCA plug but I don't plan to use it anyway. I use Arch Linux ARM.

In the case of AniDB the focus lies on the anime episodes you have stored somewhere, MyAnimelist cares more about what episodes you saw.  \r\nXDCC bots are IRC bots that send you files on demand. They are a common distribution method for fansubbed anime and offer so called packlists, where the list all the files they offer.\r\n\r\nNow to the real story: I'm a user of both AniDB and MyAnimelist, but I only maintain a list on the latter. I use AniDB of keeping up to date with newly released episodes of airing series. The problem is, that if you only want to see notifies for new releases of certain subgroups, you have to add episodes of the respective anime *from that subgroup* to your list. I, however, don't maintain a list on that site, so I'd get a ton of unnecessary notifies.\r\n\r\nNow, since I get all my new episodes from XDCC bots I though I could make use of simply parsing their packlists, which was the first thing I did: write a [JSON file](http://tareksaier.square7.ch/animu/entries.json) with all neccessary info, a small PHP script to parse the packlist and a [minimalistic site](http://tareksaier.square7.ch/animu/) to display the output. With that I always had an up to date list of all released episodes of the series I watch *and only from the subgroup I want them from*.  \r\nThe problem with that approach was, that I had to memorize the number of the last episode I saw for every of those anime. So I had to come up with something different. Since MyAnimelist always has the information on which episode of which anime I watched last it seemed natural to use that. Also, since I open the page with [my list](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/IllDepence) on it several times a day, it seemed to be a good idea to simply include the information about new episodes there.\r\n\r\nSo I wanted to write a userscript that should obtain the information from both my JSON file and the packlists, look at the site itself and, if there were any episodes released that I hadn't seen, inform me about that ... well, *same origin policy says no*. The userscript is written in JavaScript and common browsers won't let it perform an XMLHttpRequest for stuff stored on other servers than the one the site you are viewing when the script is executed is hosted on.  \r\nI had to find a workaround and I though of JSONP, a method where you create a new script tag in the head of the site with the remote thing you want to access as the src attribute of that tag. Problem is, that remote thing should be a string with a JavaScript method call, so that you actually can use what you got from the remote server. But I wanted to access packlists I had no control over. It then came to my mind, that I simply could write a PHP script that would access and parse the packlist and return a JSONP string \u2014 a JSONP proxy you could say. ^^ And then access this with my userscript.\r\n\r\nThis is what I ended up doning. :) My [JSONProxy](http://tareksaier.square7.ch/animu/jsonp.php) parses packlists based on my [listing](http://tareksaier.square7.ch/animu/entries.json) of urls, titles and subgroups and my [userscript](http://tareksaier.bplaced.net/notHP/mab/MALandBots.user.js) ([actual code](http://tareksaier.bplaced.net/notHP/mab/mab.js)) uses that to inform me about new episodes. :3\r\n\r\nI guess it would be quite easy to write a universal JSONProxy which takes a get parameter (the url to the document one wants to access) and returns a JavaScript method call with the whole site as a parameter. What I'm not sure about is, wether or not there are regulations on the src attribute of script tags and how messy the escaping of whole websites for the JS method call would get. ^^  \r\nOh and by the way: since the actual request to the site you do not control (in my case the packlists) is not performed by the browser the JS is running on but by the PHP script on your server this method doesn't even violate the same origin policy more than JSONP itself \u2014 it's just a handy way to access data from other servers when you write userscripts. :)", "date": "2012-07-19", "headline": "JSONProxy", "tags": ["programming"], "id": "bc07419d", "image": "jsonproxy.jpg"}, {"text": "A few days ago I read that the *VZ Netzwerke* (a group of dying social networks once popular in Germany) will be renamed to or restarted as *idpool*. Reading about those networks alone reminded me that ever since I stopped using them I wanted to backup all my messages. Hearing that the platform will be undergoing serious change some time soon made me take immediate action.\r\n\r\nI wrote a Perl script to extract the messages and store them in json-files. To view the messages I wrote a simple web interface in PHP.  \r\nI ran into some problems with SSL connections which is why the script uses a session ID instead of an e-mail address and password as a launch parameter. Additionally, when dealing with large amounts of messages the script decided to freeze after a certain amount of parsed messages, so I wrote a second version using threads to parse messages and in case they freeze simply parse the message again. This second version, however, is painfully slow because of my crappy implementation \u2014 but since it does a job that only has to be done once I'm fine with that. :D\r\n\r\nConcerning the web interface one thing was very important for me: having messages and answers that belong together being displayed at the same place.

The companies have stands in the hallways and lecture rooms where they introduce themselves. Students walk around to gather information relevant for a practical semester or thesis and harvest giveaways, mostly pens. One of the companies present was [OXID eSales](http://www.oxid-esales.com), they make online shops with PHP. The cool thing at their stand was, that they had t-shirts with PHP code (and their logo ofc) on them which they gave away for free. I quite like PHP, I had to get one of them, so did some of my fellow students. We continued our raid for pens ...  \r\nThen I realized something. The t-shirts that OXID gave away where exactly the same t-shits that their employees wore at their stand. I continued on that thought: people wearing such a shirt standing at their stand are thought to be OXID employees and they're asked questions about the company by students that walk by. I now possess such a shirt ...  \r\nBy now you probably figured out what I was about to do. I asked one of my mates what he thought about temporarily becoming and OXID employee. He liked the idea, we put the t-shirts on and headed off to OXID. In the end the area around the stand wasn't quite crowded enough for the plan to succeed, but the OXID employees that spotted us \"supporting their team\" happened to find it amusing what we did. As you can see they even took a picture of us at their stand.\r\n\r\n## iCTF\r\nAt university we had a team that took part in [The UCSB iCTF](http://ictf.cs.ucsb.edu), an international capture the flag event. The competition was great. The way it was set up allowed members like me, that aren't that skilled when it comes to IT security, to also contribute to the progress of one's team.

As a kid I was in a gymnastics club. I quit at the age of 12, I guess, and then, for a long, long time ... nothing. At 19 I tried to get into tricking but it didn't really work out. Tricking to me still is one of the &mdash; if not the \u2014 most beautiful expression of movement, though.  \r\nEarly this year I got into slacklining, which I still like a lot and do occasionally. But what got me super excited the moment I started was parkour. Or freerunning, or whatever may describe it best what I'm doing. I really don't care a lot about definitions and categories. As long as it isn't necessary to rate or compare within a discipline you don't need to restrict yourself to a certain set of operations or comply to any regulations. And since I'm not driven by the thought *\"I wan't to be good at parkour\"* but instead *\"I wan't to do what makes me happy and what I think is fun\"* I just do that: moving and improving \u2014 in whatever way I like to. : )\r\n\r\nWhat I find particularly interesting regarding parkour is the philosophy that developed around it. First there is the thought *\"never stop playing\"* and I couldn't identify more with it. Second there is the idea of creatively using (urban) spaces which I really like. It makes parkour kind of an art that's reaching into the spehre of everyday public life. Third there is this search for efficiency in not only movement but also thinking. It's really a whole bunch of good ideas and interestinng thought that comes along with parkour.\r\n\r\nOn top of that \u2014 one last incredibly important thing &mdash; the people are great. From what I've experienced so far, people that are into parkour tend to be extremely supportive, nice, open minded and fun. You'll get help if you need, everyone will encourage each other to try new things. It's just a great environment that supports one's authenticity.\r\n\r\nThus at the moment I'm a bit obsessed with parkour, freerunning, movement in genereal. May it remain like this for a long, long time. : )", "date": "2011-11-04", "headline": "Parkour / Freerunning / Movement", "tags": ["parkour"], "id": "5fd38d56", "image": "parkour.jpg"}, {"text": "<object width=\"526\" height=\"374\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><param name=\"bgColor\" value=\"#ffffff\"></param><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"vu=http://video.ted.com/talk/stream/2011G/Blank/JaeRhimLee_2011G-320k.mp4&su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/JaeRhimLee_2011G-embed.jpg&vw=512&vh=288&ap=0&ti=1247&lang=eng&introDuration=15330&adDuration=4000&postAdDuration=830&adKeys=talk=jae_rhim_lee;year=2011;theme=a_taste_of_tedglobal_2011;theme=talks_from_ted_fellows;theme=a_greener_future;theme=technology_history_and_destiny;theme=new_on_ted_com;event=TEDGlobal+2011;tag=Arts;tag=Design;tag=death;tag=green;tag=invention;tag=ted+fellows;&preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;\" /><embed src=\"http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf\" pluginspace=\"http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" bgColor=\"#ffffff\" width=\"526\" height=\"374\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" flashvars=\"vu=http://video.ted.com/talk/stream/2011G/Blank/JaeRhimLee_2011G-320k.mp4&su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/JaeRhimLee_2011G-embed.jpg&vw=512&vh=288&ap=0&ti=1247&lang=eng&introDuration=15330&adDuration=4000&postAdDuration=830&adKeys=talk=jae_rhim_lee;year=2011;theme=a_taste_of_tedglobal_2011;theme=talks_from_ted_fellows;theme=a_greener_future;theme=technology_history_and_destiny;theme=new_on_ted_com;event=TEDGlobal+2011;tag=Arts;tag=Design;tag=death;tag=green;tag=invention;tag=ted+fellows;&preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;\"></embed></object>  \r\n**Watch it!

What is presented to you is, among other things I guess, based on the amount of likes and replies a status update or other news item gets.  \r\nIf you don't want facebook to decide what news you get to see: only view \"Most recent\"\r\n\r\n#### Stage 2\r\nThe news feed section \"Most recent\" has the option \"Show posts from:\" which can be set to \"Friends and pages you interact with the most\" or \"All of your friends and pages\".  \r\nAgain ... Facebook filters.

The default setting for such a subsbsription is \"Most Updates\". (Options are \"All updates\", \"Most Updates\" and \"Only Important\").  \r\nAnd again: why should the user care about all updates and decide for himself, what is important to him and what is not?
